<p>According to some very lazy research I just did, the estimated number of particles in the observable universe is <math><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>96</mn></msup></math>. That's a 97-digit number. Have a look:</p>
<pre>1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre>
<p>Even though that's an unfathomably large number (imagine having to count to it), it's not <i>that</i> long – it barely fills two lines of text on my screen.</p>
<p>If you could assign a unique natural number (or <i>hash</i>) to every particle in the known universe you'd never need more than 97 digits to do it.</p>
<p>If we change the base from 10 to 64, <math><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>96</mn></msup></math> items is fewer than <math><msup><mn>64</mn><mn>54</mn></msup></math>. That means you never need more than 54 characters to assign a unique base 64 hash to every particle in the known universe.</p>
<p>That's an incredibly short string of text for such a big feat. Here's a sample I made by mashing my keyboard 54 times:</p>
<pre>09m84COSM84wf897hos_t83740FW3M-8tdocs8374tyvsc9nc3b1nt</pre>
<p>In theory, this could be the URL of a random particle in the universe. Hopefully, it's one close by.</p>
