<p>Hello!
<p>Welcome to my notebook/wallpaper/blog. This is a place where I can share my thoughts on (and stress test) <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kireji-app/demo#readme">the Kireji Project</a>.
<p>This note is short, but it took me a while to make. I had to get the framework up and running first.</p>
<p>Think of this notebook less like a blog and more like a wiki. I reserve the right to periodically improve each note and to retroactively link them all together.</p>
