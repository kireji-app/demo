return `<p>Ever since I started the Kireji project, both the Kireji Web Framework and its flagship project (the Demo App Ecosystem which includes this notebook) have been one-and-the-same. The two projects were stuck together in one repo while I worked out what the end-user experience should be for other developers using the framework. Until those design questions could be answered, I didn't want to split them up too early and risk calcifying them both.</p>
<p>I published the <a ${_.pointAttr()} href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/kireji class=external><code>kireji</code></a> package on NPM <em>six months ago</em> but it was just a placeholder to retain the name. It wasn't until this week that I was finally able to publish the very first working version of the framework.</p>
<h2>Finally, the time has come.</h2>
<p>To prove the framework works, this demo project no longer has any of the core framework files and content. Instead, this project is bringing in the framework via NPM. None of the files in this repo are necessary for the framework to function; they only define the demo applications. This process felt more straightforward than I expected it to, probably because I've been slowly refining separation-of-concerns for some time and precisely inching my way towards this moment.</p>
<p>Although the framework can be used right now via <code>npm install kireji</code> and although this very notebook application and a handful of others are already using it, (and <em>they</em> all work), there is no documentation to guide developers on its core philosophy, getting set up for the first time, or navigating its many quirks. In addition, I expect to make major changes (including breaking changes) to the framework very frequently in the coming weeks. As a result, the framework is not ready for beta testing yet. Feel free to contact me (see my social links in the footer) if you're interested in trying it out, however.</p>
<p>I look forward to tackling the aforementioned concerns very soon, but for now, this is a major milestone!</p>
<p>As a side note, I published a <a ${_.pointAttr()} href=${notes[1770103757].canonicalURL}>note</a> three days ago about the first app ecosystem that I deployed completely separately from the demo one. At the time, I copied and pasted the framework's files from the <code>demo</code> repo into that one. But now, it brings those files in via NPM just like this ecosystem does.</p>`
