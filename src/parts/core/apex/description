An apex domain is the top-most domain for which records can be added specifically to support this platform. These are the domain properties that are owned by the same people as this project. Because the project uses generic top-level-domains (gTLDs), every apex domain is a direct subdomain of a TLD (e.g. `example.com` in TLD `com`), making it a second-level domain (SLD) and every SLD is an apex domain.

All apex domains have an application located at their "www" subdomain. Each apex domain and "www" subdomain are publicly available thanks to an A record on the DNS. The server always forwards the "naked" or "bare" apex domain to its "www" subdomain.
