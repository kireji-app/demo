<p> A carefully hydrated object can serialize back to its archival size. By using the right method to add dependant properties to the archive, it can become a runtime controller and then be quickly archived using the native method <code>JSON.stringify(...)</code>.</p>
<h2>Pre-hydration: JSON Source</h2>
<p>The following is an example JSON file which has some inline code meant to equip the parsed result with runtime functionality.
</p>
<pre id="i">{
 "typename": "mix.core.parts",
 "myFavoriteNumber": 7,
 "com": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts"
 },
 "parts": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts",
  "core": {
   "typename": "mix.core.parts",
   "one": {
    "becomeAController.js":
     "dns.myFavoriteNumber = 9"
   },
   "mix": {
    "becomeAController.js":
     "console.log(\"in extension\")\nObject.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)).becomeAController()"
   }
  }
 }
}</pre>
<p>Notice the property <code>"myFavoriteNumber"</code> which will be changed from 7 to 9 if the hydration is successful.
</p>
<h2>Naive Approach: <code>a[b] = c</code></h2>
<p>The following is the original JSON parsed and hydrated using standard assignment syntax like <code>object.property = value</code> and <code>Object.assign(target, source)</code> to expand the parsed object into its runtime form. Then, the hydrated object was stringified.
</p>
<pre id="o1">{
 "typename": "mix.core.parts",
 "myFavoriteNumber": 9,
 "com": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts",
  "host": "com",
  "hydrated": true
 },
 "parts": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts",
  "core": {
   "typename": "mix.core.parts",
   "one": {
    "becomeAController.js": "dns.myFavoriteNumber = 9",
    "host": "one.core.parts",
    "hydrated": true
   },
   "mix": {
    "becomeAController.js": "console.log(\"in extension\")\nObject.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)).becomeAController()",
    "host": "mix.core.parts",
    "hydrated": true
   },
   "host": "core.parts",
   "hydrated": true
  },
  "host": "parts",
  "hydrated": true
 },
 "host": "",
 "hydrated": true
}</pre>
<p>Notice the properties "host" and "hydrated" that weren't in the original JSON. The stringified result contains redundant runtime values that aren't needed in the archive. We only want to see them at runtime. These are properties which can be inefficient - or errenous - to send over the network. For example, including the "hydrated" property in the serialized archive would cause our hydration function to skip the hydration step, resulting in the wrong prototype assignments.
</p>
<h2>Alternative: <code>Object.defineProperty(target, { ... })</code></h2>
<p>By using a different approach, we can repeatedly hydrate and archive this object without bloating it with runtime values. To do this, we need control over how visible each property is during stringification.
</p>
<p>For the below snippet, we first hydrated the original JSON using the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties"><code>Object.defineProperty</code></a> method. This allows us to control the visibility of the properties in a way that affects <code>JSON.stringify</code>. Compared to the previous attempt, we're getting the same controller behavior at runtime but when we call <code>JSON.stringify(...)</code> on it, we don't see any of the runtime values.
</p>
<pre id="o2">{
 "typename": "mix.core.parts",
 "myFavoriteNumber": 9,
 "com": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts"
 },
 "parts": {
  "typename": "mix.core.parts",
  "core": {
   "typename": "mix.core.parts",
   "one": {
    "becomeAController.js": "dns.myFavoriteNumber = 9"
   },
   "mix": {
    "becomeAController.js": "console.log(\"in extension\")\nObject.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)).becomeAController()"
   }
  }
 }
}</pre>
<p>
 This gives us a data payload that is easy to decompress, modify, recompress and share.
</p>
<h2>Predefining Properties</h2>
<p>The above method has some sticking points. For example, if we have a lot of instances where we need to add and later modify a whole bunch of non-enumerable properties, we might end up using a lot more syntax than we are used to every time we want to assign a value.
</p>
<p>Compare this:
</p>
<pre>Object.definePropertes(part, {
 host: {
  value: domains.join("."),
  writeable: true
 }
})
</pre>
<p>To this:
</p>
<pre>part.host = domains.join(".")</pre>
<p>If we know the names of all the properties that we plan to assign but don't want to serialize, we may be able to find a good point during hydration to predine them.
</p>
<pre>const nonSerializableProperties = [
 ["host", null],
 ["hydrated", false]
]

for (const [key, value] of nonSerializableProperties) {
 Object.defineProperty(part, key, {
  value,
  writeable: true
 })
}
</pre>
<p>Everywhere else, we can use normal assignment syntax throughout.
</p>
<pre>part.hydrated = true</pre>
<p>Observe the results of using this method.
