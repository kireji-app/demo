# The GUIDE

A **Universal IDE** (UIDE) is a programmable environment capable of rewriting itself. The totality of all such environments forms a **multiverse**, where each UIDE is a distinct point connected to others via editable transformations.

Within any given UIDE, a **universe** is defined by fixing the editing tools while allowing variation in the subject matter — the specific content or domain under manipulation.

Among these UIDEs naturally emerges a special subset known as **GUIDEs**: gamified UIDEs whose toolsets and subject matter are intertwined as game mechanics. This is not a mere optional feature but a necessary consequence of the kinds of software the UIDE multiverse inherently contains.

In this framing, a "save game" is simply a URL — an encoded, portable snapshot of position within the GUIDE’s universe. Because every GUIDE can be transformed into every other, GUIDEs are never just games. They are portals to other games, vectors through the multiverse, and writable histories of exploration and transformation.

## The Role of Kireji

[Kireji](https://github.com/kireji-app/kireji) was created to help define and build the first prototype UIDE and GUIDE.

It employs algebraic state spaces, the MVC paradigm, and a [minimal perfect hash function (MPHF)](https://github.com/kireji-app/mphf) hierarchy to create a reactive full-stack web framework that achieves the information-theoretic lower bound for encoding stateful information in a rigorously defined space.

This acts as a foundation which will enable the construction of a robust and usable web-based GUIDE.
